     <h2>My Life Experience...</h2>
     <h3>The most unforgettable experience is always hard for me to forget, 
         and stays fresh in my memory all the time</h3>
     <ol>
         <li>One such unforgettable moment in my memories, is of the first time I got perfect scores, and that meant a lot for a 10 years old kid. On scoring 100s 
             in all 5 subjects and being the only one in the whole class to do so, felt inexplicably exceptional. I felt happy and contented with myselfThis was a
              milestone achieved by me, all by myself only. This became a boost to my self confidence. The moment I was handed my Annual Report card, and that glow in my eyes became an unforgettable moment of my life.</li>
       <p>
              <li>People always make mistakes that can give them valuable lessons. More lessons come from their childhood because people are not old enough to think carefully. One of the most unforgettable 
            experience happened to me when I was 10 years old. It gave me a lesson that would go with me forever. This moment involves three parts: “rescuing” my best friend from his locked house, 
            exchanging a new pair of shoes for ice creams, and listening to my mom’s lecture. </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Childhood is the most unforgettable period of my life. Everyone has childhood memories. My childhood memories took place in Eritrea. These memories that are happiest and saddest memories 
                are still in my mind. Sometimes I remember things that have happened in my childhood period and they just make me laugh. Childhood memories can be bad or good, but we can’t forget them. For these reasons, childhood memories are the most important parts of my life. Specifically, also I have some good memories of childhood. The first reason that, when I was a child, I always want to be like my mother that one day 
                I’m able to start going to school, graduated,  and to have a job. I was very excited when I turned six-years-old because every Eritrean
                Everything was great and I spend a great eight years. I was a good student in all of my natural science classes, especially in Biology and Math classes. I was in contact
                 with many of my school friends and teachers in every of our school activities. I still remember playing <i>Badminton</i> for our school games when I was 10-years-old. Actually, I still play physical games and I play quite awesome, but I don’t want to be a player. 
                 In addition, my elementary school life was great and successful eight years for me. I had a great respect and personal admiration how our school teachers, stuff workers, and directors treated us especially, our educational manager, Mr. Belay Amara, because he treated everyone like his own son or daughter.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
                 <li>When I was young, I wanted to have a successful career and stable life. I believed my life would be packed a bright future because my parents gave me lots of love and warm atmosphere at home. Now, i'm in high school and 
         I want  to graduate persue my dreams and give my family same as my parents did. </li>
        </p>
        <p>
         <li>The first day when I stepped into the school was an unforgettable thing. I cried and ran away from the school gate saying that I will not go to school. After a long compromise, I went to school. But starting of each week,
              that is on Monday, I used to struggle my parents to apply for leave. But when I think now, it is fully childish.
            As days went by, I got used to school and had some interest in studies. So I leave to school early and finish my all works. 
            This is the way I got used to punctuality at least for few occasions. I had interest in drawing. My teachers supported me in bringing up my talents. I used to participate in school competitions but somehow I would win a prize at the last.</li>
