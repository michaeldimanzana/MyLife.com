    <h3>Before we talk about my personality,what exactly is personality;</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Personality is the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, 
            and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors. While there is no generally agreed upon definition of 
            personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with the environment one is surrounded by. 
            Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as traits that predict an individual's behavior. 
            On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable</h4>
